# SolarSim üåå

SolarSim is an interactive solar system simulation that allows users to explore planets, edit their properties, and visualize their orbits. The project includes features like zooming, panning, responsive design, and real-world scaling of planetary data.

---

## Features üöÄ

SolarSim includes the following core features:

1. **Central Star Visualization**: The Sun is displayed as the focal point of the simulation.
2. **Multiple Planets**: All 8 planets are rendered, each with unique colors, sizes, and orbits.
3. **Scaled Orbit Paths**: Elliptical or circular orbit paths are drawn with distances scaled proportionally according to their eccentricity.
4. **Animated Orbits**: Planets revolve smoothly around the Sun with realistic orbital speeds.
5. **Planet Details on Hover/Click**: Hover over or click on a planet to view its details, such as name, distance, radius, and orbital period.
6. **Zoom & Pan Functionality**: Use your mouse or touch gestures to zoom in/out and pan across the simulation area.
7. **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts gracefully to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
8. **Pause/Play Simulation**: Controls are provided to pause and resume the orbital animations.

### Bonus Features üåü

1. **Add/Remove Planets**: Dynamically add or remove planets from the simulation using the Planet Manager.
2. **Custom Planet Editor**: Edit planet properties (e.g., color, size, orbital speed) live through an intuitive interface.
3. **Orbit Trail Effects**: Display trailing paths behind moving planets for a visually appealing effect.
4. **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improved keyboard navigation and ARIA support for better usability.

> **Note**: A dark/light theme toggle is not included, as it does not suit the solar system simulation's visual aesthetic.
